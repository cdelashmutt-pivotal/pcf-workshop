= Service Brokers

== Goal

In this section, students will deploy a custom service broker.

. The haash-broker implements a HashMap as a Service

. Deploy the Service Broker as an app to Cloud Foundry

. Register the Broker with the Cloud Controller

. Make the single plan in the catalog “public” in your organization

. Create an instance of your service

. Push and bind a test app to your service instance

. Test the app’s interaction with the service


== Exercise

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/[Creating Custom Services]. Pay paticular attention to the service broker API.

=== Overview

The Service Broker for this lab is for a service called HashMap as a Service (HaaSh). It wraps a minimal REST API around a Java HashMap implementation, and each service creation event results in a newly allocated Map.

The source for the broker can be found link:https://github.com/krujos/haash-broker[here]. It was originally written by link:https://github.com/mstine[Matt Stine] and modified for our needs

You do not need to build the code, a jar is provided below.

=== haash-broker
* Download the hash broker
** https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pcf-icm/haash-broker.jar
* Push the broker as an app to CF.  Use the name: <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-broker

* Register the broker with the cloud controller in CF (you will need an admin to do this for you). Information required for this command can be found from the catalog endpoint (`/v2/catalog`):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf create-service-broker ...
----
+
The username & password you need for the broker are warreng/natedogg (regulate!)

*Brokers need a unique ID and name to be used in CF, to achieve this we use the time you pushed the app*

* Next, you need to make the plan public:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf enable-service-access ...
----
+
You will need to figure out the service id (and optionally plan id).  You can do this by accessing your service broker's catalog from a browser or the cli. <broker url>/v2/catalog and look in the services array ("HaaSh"). For this class, we've used the time you pushed the app as the id.

* Verify you can see your new service in the marketplace.  There is a cf command for this

* Create a new instance of your service using the CF commands.  Name the instance <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-service.

=== Haash Client

* Create a manifest for your haash-client.

* Be sure to connect the haash-client to the service instance you created above.

* Download the haash-client from S3.
** https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pcf-icm/haash-client.jar

* Push the haash-client to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and name it: <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-client

* Curl your haash client to be sure it is working and using your haash-service
+
You can add key,value pairs using:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl <your haash-client>/HaaSh/<key> -d '<some value>' -X PUT
----
+

* You can retrieve the values:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl <your haash-client>/HaaSh/<key>
----
+


== Beyond the class

There are many community resources to help you build your own more robust service broker.

* Spring developers can use the link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-boot-cf-service-broker[Spring Boot CF Service Broker]
* AppsManager (the PCF Console) could consume additional metadata to show more information about your service (like plan price etc) see link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#example-broker-response[catalog metadata] in the docs for more information.

* You following repositories can be used as a reference:
