= Application Log Draining

In this section, you will configure application log draining into a log analysis tool.  We will use the free Papertrail tool, but any tool that supports tcp syslog draining can be used.

== How it Works

. Review the log draining documentation here: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/log-management.html

. Log draining is done through a user provided service, which gives us a means of injecting credentials and coordinates (URI's, hostnames, ports, etc) into an application.  

== Papertrail

. Sign up for a free Papertrail account: https://papertrailapp.com/

. We've got some instructions set up Papertrail: http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html#papertrail.

. In a nubshell
.. Create a Papertrail account, fill in your email and whatnot.
.. Navigate to "Account" on the top nav 
.. Click "Log Destinations" on the right side. 
.. Click "Create Log Destination"
.. Ensure that "Accept logs from unrecognized systems?" has "Yes" checked
.. Ensure PlainText is checked as an access method under "Accept Connections Via" 
.. Click create
.. take note of the url (logs2.papertrail.com:<some-port>)

. Now hook it up to CF with the commands you read about above (cf cups plus some options). 
. Be sure to add your new User Provided Service to your microservice manifest. Make sure you're doing this in your **production** space!

. After you have bound your service and restaged your app, perform a few curl requests and ensure logs are draining into Papertrail.

. Scale your app to 3 instances (`cf scale <app> -i 3`) and generate some more load. Notice how the app index shows up in each log message, and how the GUID changes?
